<p>Sign language recognition is still a challenging problem inspire of many research efforts during the last many years.One of the methods of hand gesture recognition is to use the hand gloves for human computer interaction. But this method is sophisticated as it requires user to wear glove and carry a load of cables connecting the device to a computer.<p1 style="color:Green"><b>Therefore, to eliminate this complication and to make user interaction with computer easy and natural we proposed to work on sign recognition using bare hands i.e., no usage of any external wearable hardware</b></p1></p>
